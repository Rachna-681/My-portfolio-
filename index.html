    <h2> About me...</h2>
    <p>🎯 I’m Rachna Gupta, an MBA (Finance & Marketing) graduate with a passion for solving business problems through data-driven decisions and process improvement.

🚀 My skills include Excel (Advanced), SQL, Power BI, documentation, and stakeholder communication. I’ve worked in HR and customer operations roles, giving me a strong foundation in cross-functional collaboration, process tracking, and communication.

🔍 I’ve completed hands-on projects in business analysis and data analytics (Google Data Analytics, Excel for FP&A), and I’m actively seeking Business Analyst or Strategy Analyst roles where I can apply my skills to support product, process, and performance improvement.
